# MiniMongo

A Ruby Object Mapper for Mongo

## Installation

### Ruby Versions

This ODM works and is consistently tested on: CRuby 1.9.x, JRuby (in 1.9 mode) and Rubinius (in 1.9 mode). CRuby 2.0 isn't supported right now since bson_ext dependency is failing during install.

We don't have plans to support 1.8.x rubies

### Gems

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'mini_mongo'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mini_mongo
